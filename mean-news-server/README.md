# MEAN News Server

<br>


## Introduction
This server is developed in Node.js along with its Express framework.

<br>

## Environment

1. Node.js
2. Express
3. MongoDB
4. NPM 


<br>

## Usage

0. Make sure you have opened the MongoDB database;
1. `cd ./mean-news-server` to go into the source folder;
2. `npm install` to install all the npm modules;
3. `node ./index.js` to run the server in default port or by `node ./index.js 8811` to run it at port:8811. But remember to revise the Angular-Client's proxy if you want to run in other ports rather than the default one.
